    <h2>Uzor Nwachukwu</h2>
    <p>
      Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am <strong>Uzor Nwachukwu</strong>, a software engineer, football
      fanatic and all-around good guy. When I am not writing code to stave off
      Sapa, I am allowing Manchester United ruin my day, reading the next
      self-help book I picked up (screams "save me") or sleeping indoor because
      I have social anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a cloud engineering student at Altschool Africa and my
      student id is <strong>ALT/SOE/024/6071</strong>
