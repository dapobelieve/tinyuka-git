          <p>
            Hello! I&apos;m Tobe Umunna, a curious, hands-on backend intern and associate product manager, working my way into cloud engineering. I&apos;m really interested in how automation, scalability, and clean architecture come together to power real-world systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a BEng. in Chemical Engineering from Covenant University, Nigeria, and while I&apos;m still early in my journey, I&apos;m all in â€” learning fast, building small, and aiming <strong>BIG</strong>. Every day is a chance to learn, build something new, <i>and sometimes break things along the way</i>
